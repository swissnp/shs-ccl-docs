# NCCL or RCCL on Slingshot - Getting Started

This repository provides utility scripts to simplify the process of setting up the runtime environment for running NCCL or RCCL on a Slingshot fabric. By automating the cloning, building, and configuration of required components, the scripts make it easy to get started with NCCL (for NVIDIA GPUs) or RCCL (for AMD GPUs) on Slingshot.

---

## Background

Setting up NCCL or RCCL on Slingshot involves several steps, including downloading source code, configuring dependencies, and compiling libraries. These scripts ameliorate the complexities by:

- Bringing together the lessons learned from a 4 month collaboration between HPE, Nvidia, and CSCS which addressed collective communications performance at scale, performance variability, and workload hangs.
- Automating the download and build process for [NVIDIA NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl) or [ROCm RCCL](https://github.com/ROCm/rccl), the [AWS OFI NCCL Plugin](https://github.com/aws/aws-ofi-nccl), and [NCCL Tests](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests) or [RCCL Tests](https://github.com/ROCm/rccl-tests) (all optional).
- Parameterizing dependency versions like CUDA, ROCm, and Libfabric to make it easier to compose custom experiments with different library versions.
- The scripts always generate log files, so if you run out of scroll back buffer or there is a subtle difference in the build output, you have a better chance of catching the issue/behavior.

---

## Features

- **Automated Builds**: Clone and compile NCCL or RCCL, AWS OFI NCCL Plugin, and collective communications tests.
- **Customizable**: Specify library versions, directories, and build options via command-line arguments.
- **Dependency Management**: Ensures compatibility with CUDA/ROCm, Libfabric, and MPI implementations like MPICH.
- **Parallelism**: Leverage multi-threaded builds for faster setup.
- **Validation Ready**: Includes tests to verify the environment.

---

## Requirements

Before using the scripts, ensure the following are installed and available in your environment:

**For NCCL (NVIDIA GPUs):**
- **CUDA Toolkit**: Required for GPU acceleration.
- **Libfabric**: For communication over Slingshot.
- **MPI Implementation**: MPICH or another compatible MPI library.
- **Build Tools**: GCC/Clang, `git`, and `make`.

**For RCCL (AMD GPUs):**
- **ROCm**: Required for AMD GPU acceleration.
- **Libfabric**: For communication over Slingshot.
- **MPI Implementation**: MPICH or another compatible MPI library.
- **Build Tools**: GCC/Clang, `git`, and `make`.

## Usage

### Pre-Flight Steps - Loading necessary modules (NCCL)
```
module load cudatoolkit
module load PrgEnv-cray
module swap cray-mpich cray-mpich-abi
```

### Pre-Flight Steps - Loading necessary modules (RCCL)
```
module load rocm
module load PrgEnv-cray
module swap cray-mpich cray-mpich-abi
```

The scripts can be run with no command line arguments, or one can override the default options:
`./build_nccl_environment.sh [options]` for NCCL builds
`./build_rccl_environment.sh [options]` for RCCL builds

## Example Usage

### NCCL Examples:

1. **Default Build**:
```
./build_nccl_environment.sh
```

2. **Custom Build Directory and Parallelism**:
You can pass a custom build directory and also change the build parallelism (note that there are diminishing marginal returns on increasing the number of build threads)
```
./build_nccl_environment.sh --base-dir /path/to/build/directory --parallelism 32
```
3. **Use Pre-existing Repositories**:
This option can be leveraged if you are providing your own repositories or don't need to clone the repositories because you already have done so previously.
```
./build_nccl_environment.sh --skip-clone
```
4. **Skip Tests**:
In case you don't want to clone and build the NCCL or RCCL tests.
```
./build_nccl_environment.sh --skip-tests
```

### RCCL Examples:

1. **Default Build**:
```
./build_rccl_environment.sh
```

2. **Custom ROCm Version**:
```
./build_rccl_environment.sh --rccl-version rocm-6.4.0
```

## Validation

To verify the environment is set up correctly, run the appropriate NCCL or RCCL tests using the following commands (adjust parameters as needed):

### NCCL Validation

Setup Environment with build artifacts
```
# Setting up paths to dependencies
export NCCL_HOME=$(pwd)/nccl/build
export AWS_OFI_NCCL_HOME=$(pwd)/aws-ofi-nccl/src/.libs
export NCCL_TESTS_HOME=$(pwd)/nccl-tests/build

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NCCL_HOME:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AWS_OFI_NCCL_HOME:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PATH=${PATH}:$NCCL_TESTS_HOME
```

Setup NCCL - Slingshot variables

> **Note:** `ccl_env.sh` sets `NCCL_NET`, which forces NCCL to use the network
> transport. Do not source this file (or unset `NCCL_NET` afterward) for
> single-node Slurm runs, as it will cause unnecessary VNI allocation.

```source``` [ccl_env.sh](ccl_env.sh)

Run NCCL-Tests
```
cd <base-dir>/nccl-tests/build
srun --ntasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=72 --network=disable_rdzv_get ./all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 4G -f 2
```

### RCCL Validation

Setup Environment with build artifacts
```
# Setting up paths to dependencies
export RCCL_HOME=$(pwd)/rccl/build/release
export AWS_OFI_RCCL_HOME=$(pwd)/aws-ofi-rccl/lib
export RCCL_TESTS_HOME=$(pwd)/rccl-tests/build

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$RCCL_HOME:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AWS_OFI_RCCL_HOME:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PATH=${PATH}:$RCCL_TESTS_HOME
```

> **Note:** RCCL contains a known bug where it may search for `libnccl-net.so`
> instead of `librccl-net.so` when loading the network plugin. To work around
> this, explicitly point RCCL at the correct plugin:
> ```
> export NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=$AWS_OFI_RCCL_HOME/librccl-net.so
> ```

> **Note:** RCCL supports an external tuner plugin that can override the
> built-in collective algorithm and protocol selection. To load a custom tuner,
> set `NCCL_TUNER_PLUGIN` to the path of the tuner shared library:
> ```
> export NCCL_TUNER_PLUGIN=/path/to/librccl-tuner.so
> ```
> Without this variable, RCCL searches for `librccl-tuner.so` in
> `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and falls back to its internal tuner if none is found.
> The message `TUNER/Plugin: Failed to find ncclTunerPlugin_v3 symbol, using
> internal tuner instead` is normal when no external tuner is configured.

> **Note:** To enable proxy-level profiling (e.g., for debugging network
> operation timing), set `NCCL_PROXY_PROFILE` to a file path. RCCL will
> write a Chrome trace-format JSON file that can be loaded in
> `chrome://tracing`:
> ```
> export NCCL_PROXY_PROFILE=/tmp/rccl_proxy_trace.json
> ```

Setup RCCL - Slingshot variables

> **Note:** `ccl_env.sh` sets `NCCL_NET`, which forces NCCL/RCCL to use the
> network transport. Do not source this file (or unset `NCCL_NET` afterward)
> for single-node Slurm runs, as it will cause unnecessary VNI allocation.

```source``` [ccl_env.sh](ccl_env.sh)

Run RCCL-Tests
```
cd <base-dir>/rccl-tests/build
srun --ntasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=72 --network=disable_rdzv_get ./all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 4G -f 2
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Environment Variables**:
   - **NCCL**: Ensure `CUDA_HOME` and `MPICH_DIR` are set and verify the required modules are loaded.
   - **RCCL**: Ensure `ROCM_PATH` and `MPICH_DIR` are set and verify the required modules are loaded.

2. **Failed Cloning**:
   Check your connectivity to GitHub. Use `--skip-clone` if repositories are already cloned.

3. **Build Errors**:
   Review the log file in the log directory for detailed error messages.
